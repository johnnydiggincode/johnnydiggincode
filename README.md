- My name is Johnny.
- I’m interested in sports and alone time (I am an introvert). 
- I’m currently learning how to code and hopefully become a developer.
- I'd like to collaborate with anyone who is willing to help me improve. 
- Fun fact: Being a dad is the best thing to ever happen to me in my entire life.
